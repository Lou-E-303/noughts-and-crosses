# Noughts & Crosses

## Intro

Solving noughts &amp; crosses (tic-tac-toe) in JavaScript/TypeScript.

I'm creating this project to get some experience with simple programmatic search heuristics

This will eventually have a front-end which anyone can play against.

## Run

Assuming you have node installed, run `node src/main.js`.
